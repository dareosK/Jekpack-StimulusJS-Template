FROM JEKPACK DOCS:

All files located at assets folder are managed by webpack.
For all files named main.js(inside assets/javascripts) and
main.scss(inside assets/stylesheets) will be considered as entry files,
these files will be pack via webpack. In HTML, include these files via
{% asset_tag main.css %}, {% asset_tag main.js%}.

For example,
1. a file located at src/assets/stylesheets/some/page/main.scss can be included via:
{% asset_tag some/page/main.css %}

2. {% asset_path jekpack.jpg %} will return the output path of the image.
If you want to refer it in .scss files, see:

body {
  background: url(~media/jekpack.jpg);
}
